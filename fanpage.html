    <p><h3>
    Why I made This page:
        The first time I ever heard or heard of Michael Franti was at a Michael Franti concert. Franti and his band Spearhead were opening for Ziggy Marley. Franti and Spearheadâ€™s music spoke to everyone in the audience, including myself. A continues message of peace, change, tolerance, Love and acceptance of everyone was driving theme in all their music.</h3></p>
